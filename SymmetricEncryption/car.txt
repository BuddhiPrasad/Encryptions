What is Cyber Security?

Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, 
networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or 
electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, 
and can be divided into a few common categories.


The scale of the cyber threat

The global cyber threat continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with a rising number of 
data breaches each year. A report by RiskBased Security revealed that a shocking 7.9 billion 
records have been exposed by data breaches in the first nine months of 2019 alone. This figure 
is more than double (112%) the number of records exposed in the same period in 2018.
